# Iframe Coordinator Monorepo

## Getting Started

There is no need to run commands within each of the packages, setup can be done in the root monorepo directory (the parent directory of this README)

- `npm install`

  - installs each of the packages and in the example client app

- `npm run build`
  - builds each of the packages and in the example client app

## Running the example app locally

The apps can be run locally as a demo embedded in the ifc-cli host. To do so you'll need to run the following
commands from the iframe-coordinator-monorepo project root (the parent directory of this README):

`npm install`

`npm run build`

`npm run start-client-example`

You can then see the apps embedded in a host at http://localhost:3000/#/app1 and http://localhost:3000/#/app2
