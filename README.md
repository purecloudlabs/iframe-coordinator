# iframe-coordinator

Utilities for composing multiple web-apps into a single application interface via iframes.

## Setup

`npm install`

`elm-package install`

## Run it

`npm run start`

## Status

This is a technical proof-of-concept demo that embeds two basic components and was used to demo running a modified ember app as well.

Next steps will be code re-organization and adding an Ember support library to the project.
